//Goal

This project was created as a first attempt at coding with two technologies I have been curious about: Node.js and React, 
also using SQLite to implement the database engine.

The result of this project is an app that aims to connect people who want to financially contribute for a cause, with non-profit
organizations.

These organizations are able to register cases they are working with, that need financial help, and everyone who wants to help, 
just have to register themselves and select the organization, as well as the case they want to contribute for. In that way, 
both can have immediate communication, and hopefully people or animals at risk get the help they deserve.


//Technologies

Node.js
React
React Native
SQLite

//Build the server

Clone this project and run the command $ npm start on the project's folder to deploy into your local service. It should be configured for localhost:3333 - if not, please update project files.

//Run the client side

Run the command $ yarn start on the project's frontend folder, and it will open the http://localhost:3333 on your browser.
