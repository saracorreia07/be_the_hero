//Goal

This project was created as a first attempt at coding with two technologies I have been curious about: Node.js and React, 
also using SQLite to implement the database engine.

The result of this project is an app that aims to connect people who want to financially contribute for a cause, with non-profit
organizations.

These organizations are able to register cases they are working with, that need financial help, and everyone who wants to help, 
just have to register themselves and select the organization, as well as the case they want to contribute for. In that way, 
both can have immediate communication, and hopefully people or animals at risk get the help they deserve.
